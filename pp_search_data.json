Spring21 installation \" md\" Variables We can define a variable using ` ` assignment . Then we can use its value in other expressions \" x 3 y 2x md\"By default Julia displays the output of the last operation. You can suppress the output by adding ` ` a semicolon at the end. \" md\"We can ask what type a variable has using `typeof` \" typeof y md\" Functions\" md\"We can use a short form, one line function definition for simple functions \" f x 2 x md\"Typing the function's name gives information about the function. To call it we must use parentheses \" f f 10 md\"For longer functions we use the following syntax with the `function` keyword and `end` \" function g x, y z x y return z^2 end g 1, 2 md\" For loops\" md\"Use `for` to loop through a pre determined set of values \" let s 0 for i in 1 10 s i Equivalent to s s i end s end md\"Here, `1 10` is a range representing the numbers from 1 to 10 \" typeof 1 10 md\"Above we used a `let` block to define a new local variable `s`. But blocks of code like this are usually better inside functions, so that they can be reused. For example, we could rewrite the above as follows \" function mysum n s 0 for i in 1 n s i end return s end mysum 100 md\" Conditionals `if`\" md\"We can evaluate whether a condition is true or not by simply writing the condition \" a 3 a 5 md\"We see that conditions have a Boolean `true` or `false` value. We can then use `if` to control what we do based on that value \" if a 5 \"small\" else \"big\" end md\"\"\"Note that the `if` also returns the last value that was evaluated, in this case the string `\"small\"` or `\"big\"`, Since Pluto is reactive, changing the definition of `a` above will automatically cause this to be reevaluated \"\"\" md\" Arrays\" md\" 1D arrays `Vector`s \" md\"We can make a `Vector` 1 dimensional, or 1D array using square brackets \" v 1, 2, 3 typeof v md\"The `1` in the type shows that this is a 1D array. We access elements also using square brackets \" v 2 v 2 10 md\"Note that Pluto does not automatically update cells when you modify elements of an array, but the value does change.\" md\"A nice way to create `Vector`s following a certain pattern is to use an array comprehension \" v2 i^2 for i in 1 10 md\" 2D arrays matrices \" md\"We can make small matrices 2D arrays with square brackets too \" M 1 2 3 4 typeof M md\"The `2` in the type confirms that this is a 2D array.\" md\"This won't work for larger matrices, though. For that we can use e.g.\" zeros 5, 5 md\"Note that `zeros` gives `Float64`s by default. We can also specify a type for the elements \" zeros Int, 4, 5 md\"We can then fill in the values we want by manipulating the elements, e.g. with a `for` loop.\" md\"A nice alternative syntax to create matrices following a certain pattern is an array comprehension with a double `for` loop \" i j for i in 1 5, j in 1 6 "},{"url":"introduction/installation/","title":"Julia","tags":["introduction"],"text":"First-time setup: Install Julia & PlutoStep 1: Install Julia 1.11Go to https://julialang.org/downloads and download the current stable release, Julia 1.11, using the correct version for your operating system (Linux x86, Mac, Windows, etc).Step 2: Run JuliaAfter installing, make sure that you can run Julia. On some systems, this means searching for the “Julia 1.11” program installed on your computer; in others, it means running the command julia in a terminal. Make sure that you can execute 1 + 1:Make sure that you are able to launch Julia and calculate 1+1 before proceeding!Step 3: Install PlutoNext we will install the Pluto, the notebook environment that we will be using during the course. Pluto is a Julia programming environment designed for interactivity and quick experiments.Open the Julia REPL. This is the command-line interface to Julia, similar to the previous screenshot.Here you type Julia commands, and when you press ENTER, it runs, and you see the result.To install Pluto, we want to run a package manager command. To switch from Julia mode to Pkg mode, type ] (closing square bracket) at the julia> prompt:\njulia> ]\n\n(@v1.11) pkg>\nThe line turns blue and the prompt changes to pkg>, telling you that you are now in package manager mode. This mode allows you to do operations on packages (also called libraries).To install Pluto, run the following (case sensitive) command to add (install) the package to your system by downloading it from the internet.\nYou should only need to do this once for each installation of Julia:\n(@v1.11) pkg> add Pluto\nThis might take a couple of minutes, so you can go get yourself a cup of tea! Afterwards, you can now close the terminal.Second time: Running Pluto & opening a notebookRepeat the following steps whenever you want to work on a project or homework assignment.Step 1: Start PlutoStart the Julia REPL, like you did during the setup. In the REPL, type:julia> using Pluto\n\njulia> Pluto.run()\nThe terminal tells us to go to http://localhost:1234/ (or a similar URL). Let’s open Firefox or Chrome and type that into the address bar.If you’re curious about what a Pluto notebook looks like, have a look at the Featured Notebooks. These notebooks are useful for learning some basics of Julia programming.If you want to hear the story behind Pluto, have a look a the JuliaCon presentation.If nothing happens in the browser the first time, close Julia and try again. And please let us know!Step 2a: Opening a notebook from the webThis is the main menu - here you can create new notebooks, or open existing ones. Our homework assignments will always be based on a template notebook, available in this GitHub repository. To start from a template notebook on the web, you can paste the URL into the blue box and press ENTER.For example, homework 0 is available here. Go to this page, and on the top right, click on the button that says “Edit or run this notebook”. From these instructions, copy the notebook link, and paste it into the box. Press ENTER, and select OK in the confirmation box.The first thing we will want to do is to save the notebook somewhere on our own computer; see below.Step 2b: Opening an existing notebook fileWhen you launch Pluto for the second time, your recent notebooks will appear in the main menu. You can click on them to continue where you left off.If you want to run a local notebook file that you have not opened before, then you need to enter its full path into the blue box in the main menu. More on finding full paths in step 3.Step 3: Saving a notebookWe first need a folder to save our homework in. Open your file explorer and create one.Next, we need to know the absolute path of that folder. Go back to your Pluto notebook, and at the top of the page, click on “Save notebook…”.This is where you type the new path+filename for your notebook:Click
